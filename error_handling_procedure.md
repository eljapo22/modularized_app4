# Error Handling Procedure

## Critical Process for Error Resolution

When the USER sends an error message, follow these steps in order:

1. **Define ALL Errors**
   - Must identify and list every error in the message
   - Include exact error messages and their context

2. **Check for Self-Introduced Errors**
   - Review if any recent changes caused these errors
   - Be transparent about any responsibility

3. **Internal Analysis (PAUSE)**
   - Take time to fully understand the errors
   - Do not rush to solutions

4. **Code Comparison**
   - Look at current code state
   - Compare with existing code before changes
   - Understand what changed and why

5. **Solution Presentation**
   - Start with simplest, most straightforward fix
   - Present non-invasive solutions first
   - More complex solutions only if simple ones won't work

6. **Wait for Confirmation**
   - Do not proceed without USER approval
   - Wait for explicit confirmation before making changes

## Important Notes

- This process is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
- Equal in priority to not revising without USER confirmation
- Must be followed for every error message
- No exceptions or shortcuts allowed
